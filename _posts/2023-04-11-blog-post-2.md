Problem
====

Current structural alignments from Rfam use a precursor sequence to build the alignments. The sequence and position of the miR and miR* mature sequences are not reported and not considered to build such alignments.  This approach propose the improvement of the structural aligments from such microRNAs by using anchored alignments, using the mature annotation available on the miRBase and `mlocarna` to re-calculate those alignments.

Methods
====

Getting the data:
----
# TODO: Complete description of the information retrieval workflow.  <24-04-23, cavelandiah> +
I've created an automatic pipeline to get the updated information miRNA containing databases: Rfam and miRBase. Using `posgresql` I was able to retrieve the data from RFAM (v.14.9), where I retrieved all miRNA families and that incluided at least one metazoan sequence in their _full_ alignment. I retrieved the sequences using `wget`. In the same way, from `miRBase` (v.22.1), I got the files `harpin.fa` and `mature.fa`:

```bash
wget https://mirbase.org/ftp/CURRENT/hairpin.fa.gz
wget https://mirbase.org/ftp/CURRENT/mature.fa.gz
```

To get the mapping relation between both databases, I blast the Rfam sequences
to the miRBase database. The mapping relation was defined as:

- 100% identity percent.
- Zero gaps/insertions.
- Word size = 40.

Based on those initial results, the corresponding candidate must be annotated in
the same specie. I plotted this relation based on the counts from the blast
results for each sequence, accounting for the percentage of sequences that
reported a correspondence in the miRBase. This value was calculated for _seed_
and _full_ alignments, as seen in Figure 1.

General ideas about the mature position and prediction
======
By this way, the idea is to have the fasta sequences provided by RFAM. Correlating
the reported accession numbers with the relationship table, results in a split of the
provided RFAM sequences in 2 groups:
one_to_one : which represents those ones that have a representation along RFAM and miRBase.
one_to_many: Candidates represented only in RFAM alignments.
Inside the one_to_one group, exists a set of mature sequences already annotated on miRBase,
and should be used together with MIRfix to correct the reported mature(s) positions.
Once those ones are corrected and updated in terms of positions, is possible to annotate 
the other one_to_many set of sequences. Before that, I realised that RFAM seed aligments have
been made from a curated set of sequences (seed) which are reported in the database file:
seed_region_RFAM14.txt
Then, before include the one_to_many sequences, a previous filter step will be performed in
order to attach only those sequences that are previously classified as seed by RFAM.
Those means that the final multiple sequences file that will be submitted to MIRfix is composed
by:
- Mature position corrected one_to_one sequences as sequences with annotated matures from miRBase.
- One_to_many sequences, which are previously classified as seed. This set of sequences will be
the target sequences which MIRfix will annotate the correct position of the best mature sequence. 
The output files from this methodology are the multiple Stockholm alignment and the positions 
of the mature(s) sequences along all of the seed sequences from the Covariance Model. At the end,
sequences that are not included into the alignment will be discarted. 


miRNAture: correction of the RFAM sequences
-----
Based on the complete fasta sequences from RFAM v14.1, located on: 

`/scr/k70san/bogota_unal/miRNAsTunicata/miRNAture/Code/RFAM_Processing/Data/RFAM14-1Fasta`

is possible to execute the 3 stages of the pipeline: create, execute and final.
In this case, the first one is create the required files to run MIRFix.
then, to execute all please run:

`./execute_correction_RFAM_miRNA.sh`
